Ready to train !
This uses the dataset from CIFAR10 (small 32*32px img) and aims to create the same kind of image.

Keras required, see requirements.txt/environment.yml for more info.

Create env from this template with conda : conda env create -f environment.yml

Optimal with 200 generations, some cool img from 20.
